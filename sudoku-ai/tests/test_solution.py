"""This test suite includes a few basic test cases to verify your solution. However, passing these
tests does not guarantee that your solution is correct. The Project Asssistant test suite contains
many additional test cases that you must also pass to complete the project. You should write your
own additional test cases to cover any failed tests shown in the Project Assistant feedback.
